# sqlalchemy-challenge

During this project, I used concepts that I have learned to complete a climate analysis project on Honolulu, Hawaii. First, I analyzed and explored the climate data by using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database. I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib. Next, I designed a climate app. I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed. I did this by using FLask to create routes. This folder contains climate_starter.ipynb, my Jupyter notebook containing the main script used for my analysis. This folder also contains app.py, my main script used for creating the climate app.

# Images

This folder contains images that were generated during my analysis, including precipitation.png and station-histogram.png.

# Resources

This folder contains hawaii_measurements.csv, hawaii_stations.csv and hawaii.sqlite, the data files that I used for this challenge.
